#### Trees
In this Repo I created a Tree class From scratch that has different  
methods: 
 - insert() -> add new node to the tree  
 - find(node) -> travers the tree untill finding the node else return null  
 - traversePreOrder() -> trever the node in Depth first  search  
 - traversePostOrder() -> trever the node in Depth first  search  
 - traverseInorder()-> trever the node in Depth first  search  
 - BreathFirstSearch() -> traverse the tree in Breath first search and print them  
 - hieght() -> return the height of the tree  
 - getMin() -> return the smallest value in the tree  
 - equals() -> compare tow trees for equality   
 - isBindarySearchTree() -> vlaidate the tree that it is a bindary search tree 
 - printKthNodeAtDistance() -> print kth node at distance 
 - isLeaf() -> uitl mehtod to vlaidate that a given node is the last node in the tree or a sub tee
